# Concept
The main object in the scene is the number 10, referring to the 10th-anniversary. Then we have the three curves referring to the AOSC OS logo and theme color.

The top part of the number 1 is in an L shape. Combine with the bending curves to make the image looks active. And it shows the potential of the AOSC community.
